    "Answer-Min-Max scaling, also known as min-max normalization, is a data preprocessing technique used to scale numeric \n",

    "Q2. What is the Unit Vector technique in feature scaling, and how does it differ from Min-Max scaling?\n",
    "Provide an example to illustrate its application.\n",
    "Answer--The Unit Vector technique in feature scaling, also known as unit normalization or \n",
    "vector normalization, is a data preprocessing technique used to scale the values of features'\n",
    "such that each feature vector has a unit norm, often L2 norm.\n",

    "Q3. What is PCA (Principle Component Analysis), and how is it used in dimensionality reduction? Provide an\n",
    "example to illustrate its application.\n",
    "Answer-Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving the most important information in the data. PCA achieves this by identifying the directions (principal components) in which the data varies the most and projecting the data onto these new orthogonal axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how PCA works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Centering the Data: PCA first centers the data by subtracting the mean of each feature\n",
    "from the dataset. This step ensures that the data has zero mean along each feature dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute the Covariance Matrix: PCA computes the covariance matrix of the centered data.\n",
    "The covariance matrix measures the degree to which each feature varies with respect to the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues: PCA then calculates the eigenvectors and \n",
    "eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. Eigenvectors represent the directions (principal components) \n",
    "of maximum variance in the data, while eigenvalues represent the magnitude of variance along these directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Select Principal Components: PCA selects the top \n",
    "�\n",
    "k eigenvectors (principal components) corresponding to the largest eigenvalues. These principal\n",
    "components capture the most significant variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Data onto Principal Components: Finally, PCA projects the original data onto the selected \n",
    "principal components to obtain the reduced-dimensional representation of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is used in dimensionality reduction for various purposes, including visualization, data \n",
    "compression, noise reduction, and speeding up machine learning algorithms by reducing the number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example illustrating the application of PCA for dimensionality reduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset with five features representing different aspects of a house: size \n",
    "(in square feet), number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, age of the house, and price.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset using PCA while retaining most of the variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Centering the Data: Subtract the mean of each feature from the dataset to center the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute Covariance Matrix: Calculate the covariance matrix of the centered data.\n",
